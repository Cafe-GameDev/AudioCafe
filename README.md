# AudioManager: Audio Workflow Accelerator for Godot Engine

## Overview

AudioManager is a powerful Godot Engine plugin designed to streamline audio management. It automates the creation of `AudioStreamPlaylist`, `AudioStreamRandomizer`, and `AudioStreamSynchronized` resources from your raw audio files, organizing them into a centralized `AudioManifest`.

The plugin features an intuitive **AudioPanel** directly within the Godot editor, allowing you to configure asset paths, define resource save locations, and generate a complete audio manifest with ease.

## Key Features

*   **Automated Resource Generation**: Intelligently create various `AudioStream` types from `.ogg` and `.wav` files.
*   **Centralized AudioManifest**: A single `audio_manifest.tres` resource acts as a catalog for all your audio, simplifying runtime access.
*   **Intuitive AudioPanel**: Configure settings and trigger manifest generation directly in the editor.
*   **AudioStreamInteractive Support**: Collects references to manually created `AudioStreamInteractive`s into your manifest.
*   **Export Optimization**: Ensures all generated audio resources are included in your exported builds.
